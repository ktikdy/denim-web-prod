                    Arbitration. All disputes, controversies, and claims from or relating to these Terms and Conditions,
                    including any subsequent updates, shall be submitted to arbitration before the American Arbitration
                    Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. The place of
                    arbitration shall be Austin, Texas and the proceedings shall be English. The arbitrator may award
                    any form of individual or equitable and injunctive relief. Any award will be final and conclusive to
                    the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties may also plead to
                    any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or
                    other interim relief, without breach of this paragraph and without reducing the scope of the powers
                    of the arbitrator. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop any lawsuit or to remove you
                    as a participant in such a suit. By agreeing to this provision, you waive your right to bring, join,
                    or participate in a class action lawsuit related to these Terms and Conditions; however, you do not
                    waive your rights or remedies to pursue an individual claim in binding arbitration. The preceding
                    provision is an independent covenant, which you may opt out of by providing written notice of your
                    decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first use the Site.
